Bormand did a really great job deobfuscating the Toledo Javascript Chess Game,
but I wanted to take it a step further and refactored all the global variables to more clearly reflect their usage.

File toledo_javascript_chess_3.html was chosen because it does not require
external images.

See project's wiki for some info on the board:
